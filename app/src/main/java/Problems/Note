IDEA
- the system can automatically load data from local machine (at specific location), like google drive. -> difficult
- Read file from local and load to server, all the infor will be displayed in app. Besides, user also can input data from form in app.
- Should return api with key_status from server. (Search: how to return key status with rails api?)
- Multi language for app. (Add to settings, reference from facebook app)
